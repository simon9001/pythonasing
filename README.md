# pythonasingData Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib
Project Description

This project demonstrates how to analyze a dataset using Pandas and visualize results using Matplotlib (with Seaborn for styling). The Iris dataset is used for this example.

Tasks Covered

Load and Explore Data

Load dataset into a pandas DataFrame

Inspect first rows and dataset structure

Check and handle missing values

Basic Data Analysis

Summary statistics using .describe()

Group data by species and compute averages

Identify patterns and insights

Data Visualization

Line chart (trend of sepal length)

Bar chart (average petal length per species)

Histogram (distribution of sepal width)

Scatter plot (relationship between sepal length and petal length)

Findings

Iris-setosa has the smallest petals.

Iris-virginica has the longest petals and sepals.

Sepal length and petal length show a positive correlation.

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for dataset)
